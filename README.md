# These are some images from some of our microcontrollers: 
  ## 1. ESP32
  ## 2. STM32F3DISCOVERY
  ## 3. RASPBERRY PI 4

### This is a experimental setup to simulate the AMI system in smart grid.
These microcontrollers are mimicing the smart meters, they measure the energy consumption, encrypt it and send to the cloud and utility provider in order to use the data to train their AI models in a near to real-time manner.
We are not working on cloud part by considering the security and privacy of the metering data using different security scheme:
    
    > differential privacy
    > hommomorphic encryption
    > trusted execution environments
